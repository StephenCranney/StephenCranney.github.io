I have a data science LLC based out of the DC-area, with a current clientele focus of NGOs in the religion and public life space. While most quantitative analysts have demonstrable profiency in a handful of methods, I am a Swiss Army knife. My skillset covers geospatial statistics, network analysis, machine learning, actuarial and demographic methods, qualitative methods such as interviews and content analysis, data visualization, unstructured data retrieval and cleaning, machine learning, and advanced predictive analytics. 

For example, I have developed and published a psychometric scale, conducted qualitative interviews with a vulnerable population, helped create macro-level indices for an NGO, used machine learning methods to test the statistical accuracy of a clientâ€™s models, conducted seasonality analyses for a construction supplies company, used multistate life table methods to help a chain of gyms predict membership tenure, used geographic cluster analysis to determine the optimal categorization of organizational units for a client, and have performed geospatial joins of disparate data sources to derive demographic profiles of geography-based organizational units. 

Additionally, I maintain an active research agenda as a social scientist, specializing in the areas of religion, fertility, and sexuality. I am a Non-Resident Fellow at Baylor University's Institute for the Studies of Religion, teach at Bowie State University, and have published over 20 peer-reviewed studies. I have been interviewed about my research by The Guardian, Deseret News, The Atlantic, and Christianity Today.

I have a data science LLC based out of the DC area, with a current clientele focus of NGOs in the religion and public life space. Methodologically, I am a Swiss Army knife. I have either published or done client work using geospatial statistics, network analysis, machine learning, actuarial and demographic methods, qualitative methods such as interviews and content analysis, data visualization, unstructured data retrieval and cleaning, and advanced predictive analytics. 

Additionally, I maintain an active research agenda as a social scientist, specializing in the areas of religion, fertility intentions (why people want the number of children they do), and sexuality, although I have worked with statisticians, demographers, psychologists, business academics, medical researchers, sociologists, evolutionary biologists, political scientists, and criminologists. I am a Non-Resident Fellow at Baylor University's Institute for the Studies of Religion, teach at Bowie State University, and have published over 20 peer-reviewed studies. I have been interviewed about my research by The Guardian, Deseret News, The Atlantic, and Christianity Today. 

I am married with five sons, and I've written some fun listverse articles on the [mathematics of infinity](https://listverse.com/2018/04/26/10-facts-from-the-bizarre-world-of-infinite-math/) and [complex languages](https://listverse.com/2020/11/30/top-10-complex-human-languages-2020/).
